Web application that takes trending television shows and events from Twitter and displays them conveniently with where to watch details.

## Concept
The idea was to search trending hashtags on Google News and from there determine if it is a televised event and where it was be televised using a scoring algorithm.

## Issues
However the issue with content generation is that shows may not always be trending on Twitter, so often times there will be a lack of content available, such as the middle of a weekday or late at night.

## Installation
```
npm install
```
Configure /server/config.json to your liking.

## Running the Server
```
npm start
```

The client will then be accessible at `http://localhost:3001`.
